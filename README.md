# Analysis for Py City School District

<b>Summary: </b>

When changing the data for Thomas High School’s 9th grade scores to reflect NaN instead, the overall passing score for this school was affected.  In comparison with other schools, we could only use three of the four grades from Thomas High School.  We could also see that data for the effects of school size and spending could be warped due to the removal of 9th grade student data, as the overall passing scores will not accurately reflect true student data for Thomas High School.
